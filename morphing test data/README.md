raw flight data
raw data of figure eight flight
The flight data consists of 36 experiments based on the flight parameters are shown as follow:
Velocity:                1.5m/s, 2/5m/s
The number of waypoints: 20, 30 (half: 10, 15)
Morphing angle(degree):  0(no morphing), 21, 27
Flight path:             normal, oneside, twosides

each experiment has approximately 10 repeated flights to keep the realiable analysis of the flight performance
