raw data of figure eight flight <br>
The flight data consists of 36 experiments based on the flight parameters are shown as follow: <br>
Velocity:                1.5m/s, 2/5m/s <br>
The number of waypoints: 20, 30 (half: 10, 15) <br>
Morphing angle(degree):  0(no morphing), 21, 27 <br>
Flight path:             normal, oneside, twosides <br>
